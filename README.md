# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

Hey There, 

This project is a part of a series of projects on [Datacamp.com](https://learn.datacamp.com/) for Data Science with Python [Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5)

It is a guided project offering the datasets and what kind of analysis is needed with them while allowing you to perform the code that executes these functions.

In the End, it offers a series of tests to make sure the output the code generates matches what is expected of the output.

This code analyzes the length of Netflix movies over time to discover if they are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office" as well.
